This project showcases a fully functional calculator program written in assembly language using the Irvine x86 library and the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM). The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and demonstrates key concepts of low-level programming, making it an excellent resource for learning assembly language.

○ Features

➡ Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

➡ User Input Handling: Accepts input from the user through the console.

➡ Display Results: Outputs the results of the calculations directly to the console.

➡ Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for invalid operations or inputs.

➡ Modular Code: Organized into functions for better readability and maintenance.


○ Getting Started

Prerequisites - 
To build and run this project, you need the following:

➡ Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)

➡ Irvine x86 library

➡ A Windows environment (or an emulator if using a different OS)
